    <h1>Consensus Non-negative Matrix Factorization (cNMF) for Single-Cell Data</h1>
    <p>Consensus Non-negative Matrix Factorization (cNMF) is a computational method used to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to identify gene programs. Gene programs refer to sets of genes that exhibit coordinated expression patterns and are indicative of underlying biological processes or cell states.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts and Steps in cNMF for Single-Cell Data</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Data Matrix Construction</h3>
    <p>The input to cNMF is a gene expression matrix, where rows represent genes, columns represent cells, and entries represent the expression levels of genes in each cell.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)</h3>
    <p>NMF is a dimensionality reduction technique that factorizes the gene expression matrix <code>V</code> (size <code>m × n</code>) into two lower-dimensional matrices <code>W</code> (size <code>m × k</code>) and <code>H</code> (size <code>k × n</code>) such that <code>V ≈ WH</code>.</p>
    <pre><code>V ≈ W * H</code></pre>
    <p>Here,</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>V</code> is the original gene expression matrix.</li>
        <li><code>W</code> is the basis matrix, where each column represents a gene program.</li>
        <li><code>H</code> is the coefficient matrix, where each row represents the activity of a gene program in each cell.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Running NMF Multiple Times</h3>
    <p>cNMF involves running NMF multiple times with different initializations to ensure robustness and stability of the factorization. This helps in identifying consistent gene programs across different runs.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Consensus Clustering</h3>
    <p>The results from multiple NMF runs are combined using consensus clustering to determine stable and reproducible gene programs. This step involves clustering the basis vectors (columns of <code>W</code>) from different runs and identifying common patterns.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Determining Gene Programs</h3>
    <p>Gene programs are determined based on the clustered basis vectors. Each gene program consists of a set of genes that show coordinated expression patterns across the cells. The final gene programs represent underlying biological processes or cell states in the single-cell data.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>cNMF is a powerful method for identifying gene programs in single-cell RNA sequencing data. By leveraging multiple runs of NMF and consensus clustering, it provides robust and reproducible insights into the underlying biology of cells.</p>
